# language-by-example ðŸ“–âœ¨ðŸ”­

This repository tracks a list of sites and repositories that teach a programming "language by example".

Many of the "language by example" websites are a fork of (or based on) [Go by Example](https://.com). To make this list they do not have to meet that exact format, but it must be a simple list of examples and explanations for that programming language.

## Contributing

Please feel free to open an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) (or even better, a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!) to add another "language by example" website, or to suggest changes / edits.

Please follow existing conventions, as well as the following:

- All "language by example" sites shoud be free.
- The main list should be in alphabetical order. From there, sub "language by example" sites & repositories should be ordered this way:
  - First, if the "language by example" site is sponsored / managed by the same entity running that programming language, it should be listed first. (Ex: [Rust by Example](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example), the open source repo is within the `rust-lang` GitHub organization.) Most likely there are only one of these.
  - Second, "language by example" sites that are open source and live. Within this section just append to the list (add to the bottom).
  - Third, "language by example" sites that are open source but not live. Within this section just append to the list (add to the bottom).
  - Fourth, "language by example" sites that are live that are not open source. Within this section just append to the list (add to the bottom).
- Links should preferably be `https` with no trailing `/`.
